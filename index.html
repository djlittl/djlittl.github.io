    <h3><p>About me</p></h3>
    <p>I am the manager of the Computational Multiscale Department in the Center for Computing Research at Sandia National Laboratories.  My managerial role and technical background are in the development, implementation, and application of multiscale, multiphysics techniques for materials modeling and computational solid mechanics. I am a graduate of the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I earned BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering.  Prior to joining Sandia, I was a research associate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In addition to my research work, I have served as a course instructor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Syracuse University. My professional experience includes working as a Project Engineer for BNP Associates, Inc., and serving as a member of the Quark Research Lab at Quark, Inc.</p>
