My managerial role and technical background are in the development, implementation, and application of multiscale, multiphysics techniques for materials modeling and computational solid mechanics. I am a graduate of the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I earned BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering.  Prior to joining Sandia, I was a research associate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In addition to my research work, I have served as a course instructor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Syracuse University. My professional experience includes working as a Project Engineer for BNP Associates, Inc., and serving as a member of the Quark Research Lab at Quark, Inc.</p>
